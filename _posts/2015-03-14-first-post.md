Welcome to my blog. It's not very good. I'm doing it because a [lot](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) of [people](http://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/) are telling me that it might help me become a better programmer. Since that's my goal, it seems like it might be a good idea. Mostly what I'm going to be doing here is writing about my experiments and struggles as I begin my career as a professional software developer.

I suppose that's probably the best place to start. My name is Scott Harris and, 5 weeks ago, I started my new job at [Genability](http://genability.com). It's a pretty big change from my prior job as a multi-flavored analyst at a solar power developer, but I think it's the right move. Here, I get to spend my time learning new things and writing software that helps move the Renewable Energy Industry forward, rather than turning the crank on Yet Another Solar Project.

That's it for this installment. Look forward to future posts detailing me chasing my tail with:

* Learning Emacs
* Learning Java (and Spring, and Tomcat, and Maven, and...)
* Anything else that I feel like sharing
